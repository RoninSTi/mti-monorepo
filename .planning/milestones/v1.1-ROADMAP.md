## Overview

Build configuration interface for vibration analysts to manage factories and gateways through a web application.

## Phases

### Phase 12: Frontend Foundation

**Requirements**: API-INT-01, API-INT-02, API-INT-03, API-INT-04, API-INT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. useFactories() hook fetches factory list with loading/error states
  2. useCreateFactory() mutation creates factory and automatically refetches list
  3. TypeScript interfaces for Factory and Gateway match backend response types exactly
  4. API errors display user-friendly messages (not raw error objects)
  5. Optimistic updates show immediate UI feedback before server confirmation
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md -- Factory CRUD hooks with query key factory and global error handling
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md -- Gateway CRUD hooks with query key factory and factory filtering

### Phase 15: Factory Management UI

**Goal**: Complete factory CRUD interface with validation and user feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: FACTORY-UI-01, FACTORY-UI-02, FACTORY-UI-03, FACTORY-UI-04, FACTORY-UI-05, FACTORY-UI-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can view list of all factories with name, location, timezone, and creation date
  2. User can create new factory through form with inline validation errors
  3. User can edit existing factory with form pre-populated with current values
  4. User can delete factory after confirming in modal dialog
  5. All operations show success/error notifications and loading spinners during requests
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md -- Install Sonner + AlertDialog components and wire Toaster into app root
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md -- Implement FactoriesPage with full CRUD (table, dialogs, toasts, loading states)

### Phase 16: Gateway Management UI

**Goal**: Complete gateway CRUD interface with factory filtering and secure password handling
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: GATEWAY-UI-01, GATEWAY-UI-02, GATEWAY-UI-03, GATEWAY-UI-04, GATEWAY-UI-05, GATEWAY-UI-06, GATEWAY-UI-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can view list of all gateways with factory name, gateway ID, URL, and connection details
  2. User can filter gateway list by factory using dropdown selector
  3. User can create new gateway through form with factory select, gateway ID, URL, email, password, model, firmware
  4. User can edit gateway details and optionally change password (password field blank by default, only updates if filled)
  5. User can delete gateway after confirming in modal dialog
  6. All operations show success/error notifications and loading spinners during requests
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md -- Implement GatewaysPage with full CRUD, factory filtering, and secure password handling

### Phase 17: Quality & Polish

**Goal**: Production-ready code with validation, responsive design, and documentation
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: QUAL-UI-01, QUAL-UI-02, QUAL-UI-03, QUAL-UI-04, QUAL-UI-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. TypeScript strict mode enabled with zero errors
  2. All forms validate inputs with clear error messages before submission
  3. Application works on desktop (1920x1080) and tablet (768x1024) without horizontal scroll
  4. Developer can read README and set up frontend in under 5 minutes
  5. Component patterns are consistent across all pages (same hook usage, composition style)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md -- TypeScript verification, ESLint fixes, and component pattern consistency audit
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md -- Responsive design for desktop and tablet viewports
- [x] 17-03-PLAN.md -- Comprehensive frontend README documentation

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- React + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 for modern frontend stack
- shadcn/ui for component primitives with full design control
- React Query for server state management with 5-minute staleTime
- React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form validation
- Native select elements (sufficient for v1.1, accessible by default)
- No authentication in v1.1 (focus on configuration UI)
- Password security: never expose in API responses, blank in edit mode
- Client-side factory name lookup via getFactoryName helper
- Toast notifications using Sonner for all CRUD operations
- Responsive design with mobile nav (no hamburger menu needed)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled from start
- Manual type maintenance from backend Zod schemas

**Issues Resolved:**
- shadcn CLI bugs (creates literal @/ directory, incorrect imports)
- Password field security in gateway edit forms
- Factory name display in gateway list (UUID → name resolution)
- Factory filter cache invalidation (computed query params)
- Component pattern consistency across pages
- Responsive column hiding at appropriate breakpoints
- ESLint react-refresh warnings for Zod schema exports

**Issues Deferred:**
- Authentication (future milestone)
- Multi-tenancy (single org mode with DEFAULT_ORG_ID)
- Dark mode support (light theme only)
- Real-time gateway status updates (WebSocket integration)
- Code splitting optimization (533kb bundle acceptable for v1.1)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None. Phase 17 addressed all quality concerns with zero errors.
